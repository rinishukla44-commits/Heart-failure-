# Heart-failure-
Power BI dashboard analyzing Heart Failure Dataset from Kaggle. Visualizes key health indicators like age, cholesterol, chest pain type, and gender to identify patterns and risks related to heart disease. Built using Power BI and Python for data integration.
# ❤️ Heart Failure Analysis Dashboard (Powered by Power BI)

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes **Heart Failure Data** using **Microsoft Power BI** to uncover patterns, relationships, and risk factors influencing heart disease.  
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle - Heart Failure Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tan5577/heart-failure-dataset).

The dashboard provides interactive insights into patient demographics, cholesterol levels, chest pain types, and heart disease outcomes.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- Understand the **relationship between age, cholesterol, and heart disease**.
- Identify **key predictors** such as chest pain type, fasting blood sugar, and max heart rate.
- Provide a **visual summary** to support clinical or academic research on cardiovascular health.
